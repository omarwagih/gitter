# gitter: An R Package for Quantification of Pinned Microbial Cultures


gitter allows robust and quick quantification of pinned colony sizes in plate images. gitter works by first finding the grid of colonies from a preprocessed image and then locating the bounds of each colony separately. It includes several image pre-processing techniques, such as autorotation of plates, noise removal, contrast adjustment and image resizing.
